Consul is fully platform agnostic. Consul is [fully open source](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul). Consul handles the following areas within a Kubernetes cluster:

- Service discoverability, both internal and external allowing you to mix containers with EC2 VMs, server-less services and external services
- Secure communication between services
- Load balancing
- Automatic scaling
- Feature toggles on services (for example, route outgoing call to internal or external service)
